## 👋 Hi there

I'm Kacper, a .NET Developer from Poland. This is where I work and live.  
But I am really interested in moving out of my fatherland sometime soon. And no _soon_ is _too soon_.

#### 📌 What I'm up to:
- ⚙️ working full-time as a remote **.NET backend developer**, but I'm requesting more and more frontend tasks these days
- 🛠️ developing [LitesiteCMS.js](https://github.com/turowski-k/litesite-cms-js), **a lightweight client-side CMS**, as a fun hobby project
- 📒 working my way through several webdev courses to expand my role **into full-stack development**
- 🈂️ trying to **learn Japanese**, I'm already through hiragana and katakana, and I fear kanji

#### ✨ And I'm:
- ⚙️ using **.NET Core** and **MSSQL** at work, sometimes **JavaScript** and **CSS** too
- ⚙️ able to use **MEAN** and **PHP** and some others, if needed
- 👀 interested in **machine learning** and **neural networks**
- 🔍 learning everything about **full-stack webdev**
- 📨 reachable at [@turowski_k](https://twitter.com/turowski_k)
- 🍻 in love with **non-alcoholic beer**, but not really into crafts
- 🦉 a **coffee person** and a **night owl**

#### 💁 Also:
- 💬 talk to me about **mental health**, **tarot**, **occult and supernatural** and **video games**
- 🖥️ my first computer was **Atari 65XE** with a casette drive
- 🦉 the owls are **not what they seem**

#### 🛫 I want to leave Poland, because I want to:
- 🌍 see the world
- ⛩️ experience different cultures
- 🍖 eat weird food
- 🤭 meet awesome people
- 🗻 go on unforgettable adventures
- 🤓 and work on amazing projects!
